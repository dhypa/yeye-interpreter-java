Interpreter for a custom programming language. 

Hopefully by the end of this, I will have produced an interpreter that can handle a non-trivial language with OOP and functional features.</br>
Currently working on parsing code. 

## Usage 

First argument can be used to give the interpreter source code. </br> 
If no arguments are provided, it is started as a REPL (read execute print loop), like the js console in popular browsers, or like a terminal. 

```
java Main <file path containg code>
```
